# Reps and Sets

## Goals of Project
Project for Hack the 6ix 2022 Event. The goal of the project is to be a place to document one's workout goals and needs.

## Inspiration
Exercise, exercise, exercise! One day, I was working out with a friend for the first time, and he explained how he had different exercise goals and a series of reps. With so many different exercises, I imagined it was hard to know which set to do. As such, I made this website to be able to track individual goals. When someone is at the gym, they can open this website and figure out the amount of reps and exercises they did the day prior and update it. 

## What it does
A form with a connected database, each time a user exercises they can look at their past exercises and the count, and update their progress the day.

## How I built it
- Front End: Tailwind CSS, ReactJS
- Back-End: Express
- Database: MongoDB

## Challenges I ran into
Figuring out site architecture and goals for the project (reasonable scope as it was done individually rather than a larger team). Also, time management.

## What's next for Reps
More graphs and tracking to improve the user experience. Also, having a mobile app would be great. An offline mobile app would be great in the long run.
